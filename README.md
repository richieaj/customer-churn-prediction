# customer-churn-prediction
- In an era of increasing customer expectations and fierce competition, understanding customer behavior and optimizing customer retention is paramount for any successful bank. Our project aims to leverage advanced machine learning techniques to predict customer churn for targeted marketing strategies.

- The project starts by analyzing a comprehensive dataset containing various attributes of bank customers, including credit scores, estimated salaries, balances, and geographical locations.

- We have employed logistic regression and Random forest, the two powerful classification algorithms to predict customer churn. By training a logistic regression and Random forest model on historical customer data, we can accurately identify patterns and factors contributing to customer attrition. This enables banks to retain at-risk customers and optimize their retention strategies proactively.

- Our project leverages advanced machine learning techniques, specifically random forest, and logistic regression models, to analyze customer behavior in the banking industry. Through meticulous analysis and evaluation, we assess the performance of these models in their respective territories, providing valuable insights for customer retention and strategic decision-making.
